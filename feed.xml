It was developed for Google, the successor to Sibyl, and released in public in 2017. I read the original paper that accompanied its release to understand the problems it was trying to solve, as well as to get a handle on the specific context in which it was developed. (It’s worth being wary about tools developed at places like Google; after all, hardly any of us are operating at Google-scale).</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.mlops.systems/images/tensorflow-extended-tfx-logo-social.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.mlops.systems/images/tensorflow-extended-tfx-logo-social.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Managing Python Environments with pyenv and pipenv</title><link href="https://www.mlops.systems/python/2021/09/10/python-environments.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Managing Python Environments with pyenv and pipenv" /><published>2021-09-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.mlops.systems/python/2021/09/10/python-environments</id><author><name>Alex Strick van Linschoten</name></author><category term="python" /><summary type="html">It’s hardly news that that managing multiple versions of Python in a development environment is hard.

It’s a new field to me. I’ve read a good deal on it in recent weeks, and listened to a few dozen episodes of the MLOps.community podcast, but I still very much consider myself a beginner in the space. To that end, I thought it worth clarifying my understanding of what MLOps is all about, the problem it is trying to solve, and where I see the opportunity there.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.mlops.systems/images/mlops-venn-diagram.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.mlops.systems/images/mlops-venn-diagram.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
