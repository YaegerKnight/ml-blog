Hi, I'm Alex.

I am a software engineer based in London, UK. I recently built Ekko, an open-source framework allowing developers to easily add realtime infrastructure and in-transit message processing to web applications.

I have multiple years of experience in the Ruby and JavaScript
ecosystems and am comfortable working with Go, PostgreSQL, AWS cloud infrastructure and Docker.

I have a PhD in History and authored several books based on my research work in Afghanistan.
