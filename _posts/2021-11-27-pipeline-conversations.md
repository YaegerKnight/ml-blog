I'll be co-hosting a new podcast about MLOps, with new episodes out every fortnight. [Pipeline Conversations: A Machine Learning Podcast by ZenML](https://podcast.zenml.io) is the new podcast from [the company where I work](https://zenml.io/). (We build [an open-source tool](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) for data scientists to empower them to take control of how their models live in production.)

Our first episode gets into some of the background for why ZenML exists in the first place. Upcoming episodes will be discussions with guests from the data science and MLOps space.

I'm excited to get the opportunity to talk with so many interesting and smart people.
