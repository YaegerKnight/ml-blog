Hi, I'm Alex.

I am a software engineer based in London, UK. I recently built [Ekko](https://ekko-realtime.com),
an open-source framework allowing developers to easily add realtime
infrastructure and in-transit message processing to web applications.

I have multiple years of experience in the Ruby and JavaScript
ecosystems and am comfortable working with Go, PostgreSQL, AWS cloud
infrastructure and Docker.

I have a PhD in History and authored [several books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/authors/54a432af-7151-490e-a2fd-61798ea14e94) based on my
research work in Afghanistan.

I have [a long-standing blog](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog) that I will combine with this one at some
point, but for now I intend to post technical posts here.
